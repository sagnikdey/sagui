A select whose trigger grows into the list, with a gliding highlight and type-ahead.

<!-- demo: Hero -->

## When to use


- Form fields and property panels where one value is picked from a known list.
- Grouped lists like time zones, assignees, or projects, with optional icons and meta.
- Compact toolbars where the picker should look like a pill until opened.

## When not to use


- Use combobox when users type free text or the list is very long and remote.
- Use multi-select when more than one value can be chosen.
- Use dropdown-menu for actions rather than a stored value.

## Installation

Install the package and import the styles once. The [installation guide](/docs/installation) covers the Tailwind setup.

```bash
npm install @sagui/ui
```

## Usage


```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { MorphSelect } from "@sagui/ui";

export function TimezoneField() {
  const [zone, setZone] = useState<string | null>("europe/zurich");
  return (
    <MorphSelect
      label="Time zone"
      name="timezone"
      value={zone}
      onValueChange={setZone}
      items={[
        { label: "Europe", options: [
          { value: "europe/london", label: "London", meta: "UTC+0" },
          { value: "europe/zurich", label: "Zurich", meta: "UTC+1", keywords: "switzerland" },
        ] },
        { label: "Americas", options: [
          { value: "america/new_york", label: "New York", meta: "UTC−5" },
          { value: "america/los_angeles", label: "Los Angeles", meta: "UTC−8" },
        ] },
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```

## Examples

### Groups

Pass groups as `{ label, options }` between loose options. The list keeps the order you give it.

<!-- demo: Grouped -->

### Aligned to the end

`align="end"` keeps the trigger's right edge still while the surface grows to the left.

## API reference


### MorphSelect

A select whose trigger grows into the option list, with groups, type-ahead, optional search, and a label that flies back into the trigger.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` (required) | `string` | – | Visible label, also the accessible name of the trigger and the list. |
| `hideLabel` | `boolean` | `false` | Keeps the label for assistive technology only. |
| `items` (required) | `MorphSelectItem[]` | – | Options { value, label, icon?, meta?, keywords?, disabled? } or groups { label, options }, in display order. |
| `value` | `string \| null` | – | Controlled selected value. |
| `defaultValue` | `string \| null` | `null` | Uncontrolled starting value. |
| `onValueChange` | `(value: string, option: MorphSelectOption) => void` | – | Called with the new value and its option. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | `"Select"` | Trigger text with no selection. |
| `searchable` | `boolean \| "auto"` | `"auto"` | Shows a search field in place of the trigger when open. auto turns it on above eight options. |
| `searchPlaceholder` | `string` | – | Search field placeholder. Defaults to the selected label, then "Search". |
| `panelWidth` | `number` | `272` | Width of the open surface in px. Never narrower than the trigger. |
| `maxListHeight` | `number` | `296` | Tallest the option list gets before it scrolls, in px. |
| `align` | `"start" \| "end"` | `"start"` | Which edge of the trigger stays put while the surface grows. |
| `name` | `string` | – | Adds a hidden input for native form submission. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables the trigger. |
| `className` | `string` | – | Extra class on the root. |

## Keyboard interactions


| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Enter / Space / ArrowDown / ArrowUp | Opens the list on the selected option; Enter or Space picks the active option when open. |
| ArrowDown / ArrowUp | Moves the active option, skipping disabled ones. |
| PageDown / PageUp | Moves eight options at a time. |
| Home / End | Moves to the first or last option; when closed, opens on it. |
| Alt + ArrowUp | Picks the active option and closes. |
| Printable characters | Type-ahead jumps to a matching label, or starts a search when search is on. |
| Escape | Closes and returns focus to the trigger. |
| Tab | Closes and moves focus on without picking. |

## Accessibility


- The trigger is a role="combobox" with aria-haspopup="listbox", aria-expanded, and aria-activedescendant pointing at the active option.
- With search on, the input takes over as the combobox with aria-autocomplete="list", and the trigger turns inert.
- Options are role="option" with aria-selected and aria-disabled; groups are role="group" labelled by their heading.
- A polite status announces the number of search results or No matches.

## Motion


- The trigger surface grows into the list on a physical spring with slight bounce and folds back without overshoot; the corner radius morphs with it.
- One highlight glides between options; the chosen label lifts out of the list and flies into the trigger while the trigger width springs.
- Values in the trigger roll up or down depending on whether the new option is later or earlier in the list.
- Reduced motion jumps the size, removes the fly and roll, and uses short fades.

## Responsive behavior


- The closed trigger sizes to its label up to min(20rem, 100vw - 2rem); the open list is max(trigger width, min(panelWidth, 100vw - 2rem)).
- Set align="end" for triggers near the right edge so the surface grows leftward.
- Hover highlight follows the mouse only; on touch a tap picks directly, and hover styles apply only on fine pointers.

## Performance


- A hidden measuring copy and a ResizeObserver size the trigger and list; the surface animates width, height, and radius through motion values.
- All options render; there is no virtualization, so keep lists to a few hundred items.
- Search filters in memory on label, meta, and keywords.

## Notes


- Use for compact property pickers and form fields with up to a few hundred options, including avatars or icons.
- Add keywords to options so search matches synonyms; meta shows trailing detail like counts or offsets.
- Pass name to submit with a native form; the hidden input carries the value.
- Use combobox when people mostly type free text, and multi-select for several values.
